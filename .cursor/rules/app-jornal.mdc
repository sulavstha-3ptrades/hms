 # Development Journal Rules

##  Purpose
- In the **development-journal** maintained **by the AI** to help track progress, record milestones, and log important conversations.


1. **Always Append, Never Delete**
   - All new entries must be **appended** to the journal.
   - **Do not delete or overwrite** any existing content, unless explicitly instructed.

2. **Be Thorough**
   - Provide **detailed and comprehensive** summaries.
   - Include relevant code decisions, design discussions, feature updates, and key questions asked by the user.

3. **Track Milestones**
   - Clearly mark project milestones with headings.
   - Include dates and a brief description of what was accomplished.

4. **Log Conversations**
   - Summarize any meaningful conversation related to development goals, blockers, or design rationale.
   - Reference the user's intent or reasoning when relevant.

5. **Auto-Reference on Session Start**
   - On a new session or conversation, **read the journal automatically** to get project context.
   - If unsure about the current state, ask the user or **reread the journal**.

6. **Maintain Consistent Format**
   - Use clear markdown sections (`##`, `###`) for readability.
   - Separate journal entries by date.
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists for structure when appropriate.
    

> âœ… Follow these rules consistently to improve long-term collaboration and development flow.
