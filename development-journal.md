### Booking Confirmation Dialog Refactoring

#### Changes Made:
1. **Renamed FXML File for Clarity**
   - Renamed `BookingConfirmation.fxml` to `BookingConfirmationDialog.fxml` to clearly indicate its role as a dialog
   - Maintained the same UI structure and component hierarchy

2. **Refactored BookingConfirmationController**
   - Reduced controller scope to focus solely on dialog UI logic and field bindings
   - Removed business logic and data processing from the controller
   - Implemented a clean `setBookingDetails()` method for explicit data binding
   - Simplified the controller by removing unnecessary methods and properties

3. **Updated HallBookingController Integration**
   - Modified the dialog creation and display logic in `HallBookingController`
   - Implemented proper data flow between controllers using the new API
   - Improved error handling for dialog initialization
   - Added programmatic button text customization for better UX

4. **Improved Data Flow**
   - Established clear data passing between parent controller and dialog controller
   - Implemented proper parameter validation in the dialog controller
   - Simplified the dialog result handling in the parent controller

5. **Fixed FXML Button Declaration Issues**
   - Resolved issues with ButtonType declarations in FXML
   - Implemented proper use of standard ButtonType constants
   - Added programmatic button customization in the controller instead of FXML

#### Benefits:
- **Cleaner Separation of Concerns**: Dialog controller now only handles UI presentation
- **Improved Maintainability**: Simplified controller with focused responsibilities
- **Better Testability**: Clear interfaces make unit testing more straightforward
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Dialog controller can be more easily reused in other contexts

#### Technical Decisions:
- Used JavaFX's `DialogPane` for consistent dialog presentation
- Implemented parameter validation in the dialog controller to ensure data integrity
- Used formatted date/time display for better user experience
- Followed MVC pattern with strict separation of UI logic from business logic
- Applied programmatic UI customization for elements that can't be fully configured in FXML

#### Next Steps:
1. Apply similar refactoring pattern to other dialog controllers
2. Create reusable dialog base classes to further reduce code duplication
3. Implement unit tests for the dialog controllers
4. Add form validation feedback in the dialog UI

#### Troubleshooting Notes:
- JavaFX ButtonType constants (OK, CANCEL) can't have their text property set directly in FXML
- Instead, use standard ButtonType constants in FXML and customize button appearance programmatically
- Always check for null when looking up buttons in the DialogPane to avoid NullPointerExceptions

### Booking System Refactoring

#### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed BookingStatus Enum**
   - Updated status from `CANCELLED` to `CANCELED` to match the enum definition
   - Ensured consistent status handling throughout the application

2. **Removed Duplicate Method**
   - Removed duplicate `cancelBooking` method from `BookingService` class
   - Consolidated booking cancellation logic into a single method

3. **Improved UI/UX**
   - Added proper date/time formatting in the customer dashboard
   - Enhanced the booking confirmation form with real-time cost calculation
   - Added input validation for booking times

4. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed compilation errors related to date/time handling
   - Resolved issues with booking status updates
   - Added proper error handling for invalid time ranges

5. **Code Quality**
   - Added proper JavaDoc comments
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Fixed lint warnings and improved code organization

#### Next Steps:
1. Add unit tests for the booking service
2. Implement pagination for the bookings table
3. Add filtering and sorting capabilities to the bookings view
4. Implement email notifications for booking confirmations and updates

### Technical Decisions:
- Used JavaFX's `Platform.runLater()` for thread-safe UI updates
- Implemented proper date/time handling with `LocalDateTime`
- Used Java's built-in logging framework for error tracking
- Followed MVC pattern for better separation of concerns

### Issues Resolved:
- Fixed duplicate method definitions in `BookingService`
- Resolved date/time formatting issues in the UI
- Fixed booking cancellation logic
- Improved error handling and user feedback
